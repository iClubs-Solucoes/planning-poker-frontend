# File structure

**This is your source code tree:**

```
src
|-- common
   |-- assets
   |-- mocks
   |-- stories
   |-- styles
   |-- utils
|-- components
|-- config
|-- container
|-- hooks
|-- pages
|-- routes
|-- services
|-- Bootstrap.tsx
|-- index.tsx
...
```

**This is your component structure:**

```
...
components
|-- YourComponent
   |-- YourComponent.tsx
   |-- YourComponent.stories.tsx
   |-- YourComponent.spec.ts
   |-- interfaces.ts
   |-- styles.ts
   |-- index.tsx
...
```

**This is your page structure:**

```
...
pages
|-- YourPage
   |-- components/
   |-- YourPage.tsx
   |-- YourPage.stories.tsx
   |-- YourPage.spec.ts
   |-- interfaces.ts
   |-- styles.ts
   |-- index.tsx
...
```

**These are the folders and their functions:**

`./common`

Here are all the project assets that will be used by the application such as global styles, images, fonts, mocks, stories, reusable functions, among others

`./components`

Components are presentational only elements, grouping UI items

`./configs`

Configs are our application's global settings files

`./containers`

Containers are responsible for handling dependency injection, decoupling the application from the library

`./hooks`

Hooks are functions that allow you to “plug in” to React's state and lifecycle features from functional components

`./pages`

Pages are mapped in routes and have all the containers needed to implement a functionality

`./routes`

Routes contains the `react-router-dom` implementation to map the project's routes to the respective pages

`./services`

Contains all the files responsible for consuming external services, such as the axios configuration file for consuming RestFul APIs.

### More utils commands
